# Cushon ISA Assignment

## Build and Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

## TODO
- finish testing framework scaffolding
  - add tests for React components and hooks
- move all copy / translations to a central file and import 
- consider generalise API hooks
- refactor Parent -> ISAListItem props to better isolate rendering logic from rendering details (i.e structure vs copy)
- use a better loading 'spinner'
